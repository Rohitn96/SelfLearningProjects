# Web Scraping

The web scraping component allows you to collect EPL match data from websites that provide match statistics and scores. This data can be used for training your prediction model or for other analytical purposes.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (Requests, BeautifulSoup)

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository or download the provided code file.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
3. Configure the script to scrape data from your chosen website(s) by modifying the URL(s), HTML structure, and data extraction methods.
4. Run the Python script.

## Usage
- The script will send HTTP requests to the specified website(s).
- It will parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup to extract relevant data such as match scores, team names, and dates.
- You can save this scraped data in a CSV file for further analysis or use it in the EPL match outcome prediction script.

# English Premier League Match Outcome Prediction

This part of the project involves predicting the outcomes of English Premier League (EPL) matches using a Random Forest Classifier. It leverages historical EPL match data to train and test a machine learning model.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn)

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository or download the provided code file.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
3. Place your EPL match data in a CSV file named "matches.csv." The data should include information about match dates, teams, scores, and relevant attributes.
4. Modify the code as needed, especially if your dataset structure differs significantly from the example provided.
5. Run the Python script.

## Usage
- The script will load and clean the EPL match dataset.
- It sets up a Random Forest Classifier with defined hyperparameters.
- The dataset is split into training and test sets.
- The model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the test data.
- The script outputs the accuracy of the model in predicting EPL match outcomes.
